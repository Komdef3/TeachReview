# TeachReview
A Web Application
Teach Review is a web application where class delegates of each course write reviews about the lecturers and be able to submit the administrative questionnaire form to the administration at the end of each semester. It also allows students to write reviews about activities, events about the school, about their courses and talk about the different problems faced in the school environment.
It offers a comprehensive database of courses that are done in each department. Users can easily write, like, share, and comment reviews. 
Teach Review aims to bridge the gap between students and the administration, providing a seamless and efficient platform for students(delegates only) to review their lecturers. 
Also, to reduce the stress of using sheets of paper to review teachers. Our platform also provides the means to submit the Student Course Evaluation Questionnaire every semester to the administration.
Join our platform to review our amazing lecturers.

Tools (programming languages)

During the process of building teach review, the different tools that we used were:
The different tools used in  the front end  are  HTML, CSS, Tailwind.Css, React.Js,
The different tools used in  the back end are Node.Js (Express.Js), MongoDB (Database)
	React.js which is a JavaScript framework for building UI
	Tailwind.CSS and  CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)  for styling
	MongoDB which is our database used while testing our different API
	Node.js which is a run time environment for JavaScript  and Express.js which is a node module for back-end
	Insomnia to test our different  APIs 

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

I.	AWS S3 buckets: We utilized AWS S3 buckets as a storage solution for our web application. This allowed us to securely and reliably store and serve our application's files.

II.	AWS EC2:  We leveraged EC2 instances as virtual servers to host and run our back-end. By launching EC2 instances, we were able to configure the necessary operating system, install web servers, and create and manage the back-end resources for our application, including authentication, API endpoints, and database functionality.

III.	AWS  AUDIT: it’s a service that helps automate and streamline the process of auditing AWS resources for compliance. We used Audit Manager to define and manage the controls and frameworks relevant to our project's compliance requirements.

IV.	AWS guard duty:  it’s a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity in AWS environments. We configured Guard Duty to monitor and analyze our AWS resources for potential security threats and vulnerabilities. It helped us identify and respond to suspicious behaviour, unauthorized access attempts, and other security issues.

V.	API GATEWAY: This AWS acts as a gateway and API management service for our web application. It provides a secure interface for our front-end to communicate with the back-end service

VI.	AWS CLOUDSHELL:  This is a browser-based shell environment that provides a command line, runs scripts, and executes commands for provisioning and managing our infrastructure on AWS.

VII.	 AWS AMPLIFY: it’s a development platform that simplifies the process of building and deploying web applications. We used Amplify to host our front end.
